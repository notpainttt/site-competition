# Site Competition Repository

Welcome to my competition archive! This repository serves as a central storage for most of the competition files and projects I have worked on and passed throughout the years.

## 📂 About This Repository

Here you will find a collection of:
* **Competition Files:** Source code and solutions from various competitive programming events.
* **Projects:** Competitive projects I have completed.

## 🚀 How to Navigate

To keep things organized, I have separated the content by year or competition into different branches.

**To view my work from a specific year or event:**
1.  Click on the **Branch** dropdown menu at the top left of the file list (default is usually `main`).
2.  Select the branch you are interested in. The naming conventions are:
    * `{year}`: For past competitions sorted by year (e.g., `2023`, `2024`).
    * `running-{event}-{competitive}`: For active competitions where I (or other contributors) are currently participating.

*Feel free to explore the branches to see my progress and solutions over time!*
